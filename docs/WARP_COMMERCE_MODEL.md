# WARP COMMERCE MODEL
## The Formal Specification of Commerce
### Version 0.2 — Market-Making Commerce Incorporated

---

## Status

This document is the authoritative specification of the Warp Commerce Model.
It defines what commerce is with sufficient precision that two independent
implementations produce compatible results.

This is not a technical specification for any particular system.
It contains no implementation code, no platform references, no tooling
decisions. It answers one question: what is commerce, stated formally.

**Stability:** This document is in active development. The five primitives
are stable. The invariants are stable. Extensions are being validated
through adversarial testing across commerce domains.

**v0.2 changes from v0.1:** Four additions following adversarial testing
of market-making commerce (auctions, prediction markets, derivatives,
two-sided matching, collateral lending). The five primitives held.
Additions: CommitmentState::Tendered, ValueState::UnderAuction,
AuctionProcess auxiliary record, corrected lifecycle diagram.

## Preamble

Every commerce platform in existence today — SAP, Shopify, Odoo, Magento,
WooCommerce, Amazon, Alibaba — has its own model of commerce. SAP calls
an order a SalesOrder. Shopify calls it an Order. Odoo calls it a
sale.order. These are the same concept expressed in incompatible vocabularies.

This incompatibility is not accidental. Each platform modeled commerce
to serve its own implementation needs. None modeled commerce to serve
commerce itself.

The result: every integration between platforms requires custom mapping
work. Every AI system that touches commerce must learn each platform's
vocabulary independently. Every developer who moves between platforms
must relearn the same concepts expressed differently.

The Warp Commerce Model exists to end this.

It defines what an order is — not what Shopify thinks an order is, not
what SAP thinks a SalesOrder is, but what an order formally is, stated
precisely enough that any platform's representation of an order can be
mechanically mapped to the model and back.

When two systems share this model, commerce data can move between them
without custom integration. When an AI agent reasons against this model,
its commerce reasoning is formally grounded rather than probabilistic.
When a compiler enforces this model, commerce mistakes are impossible
to express rather than merely likely to be caught.

This is what SQL did for data. SQL did not describe how MySQL stores
data or how PostgreSQL stores data. It described what data is —
tables, rows, columns, relationships — stated precisely enough that
every database vendor could implement it independently and produce
compatible results.

The Warp Commerce Model does the same for commerce.

## Foundational Axioms

These are not design decisions. They are observations about what commerce
is, verified across every commerce system that has ever existed in any
culture at any scale.

**Axiom 1 — Commerce requires at least two parties.**

Every commerce operation involves at minimum one party offering value
and one party receiving it. Single-party operations — a person moving
their own goods from one place to another — are not commerce. Commerce
begins when a second party enters.

**Axiom 2 — Commerce transfers or grants access to value.**

Value is what moves in commerce. It takes multiple forms — physical
goods, digital goods, services, money — but in every commerce operation
something of value changes hands or access to something of value is
granted. Commerce without value exchange is not commerce.

**Axiom 3 — Commerce operates through states with valid transitions.**

Every commerce operation exists in a defined state at every moment.
Transitions between states follow rules. An operation is valid if and
only if its state transitions follow those rules without violating the
invariants of the system.

**Axiom 4 — Commerce state is fully determined by its history.**

The current state of any commerce operation can be determined entirely
from its history of state transitions. No state is hidden, ambiguous,
or requires external judgment to determine. This axiom is what makes
the model useful for AI systems — a system with access to the full
history of a commerce object can determine its current state and valid
next transitions without human input.

## The Five Primitives

Everything in commerce derives from five primitives. No commerce operation
anywhere in the world requires a concept outside these five. This claim
has been tested adversarially across physical goods commerce (including
Amazon, Alibaba, Temu, Shein, and Net-a-Porter), multi-recipient gifting
with returns, physical retail POS including multi-store chains and
franchise models, services commerce including appointments, subscriptions,
gig economy, and professional services with milestones, financial commerce
including BNPL, loans, insurance, escrow, and currency exchange, digital
commerce including software licensing, streaming, API access, and NFTs,
and market-making commerce including auctions, prediction markets,
derivatives, two-sided matching, and collateral lending.

The five primitives hold across all domains. Extensions to these primitives
are required for specific domains. No sixth primitive has been found
necessary across any tested domain including market-making commerce.
Auctions require two extensions to existing primitives —
CommitmentState::Tendered and ValueState::UnderAuction — and one
auxiliary coordination record (AuctionProcess), but no new primitive.

**On the "pricing is outside the model" boundary:**

This is a deliberate design decision with a known consequence. The model
does not represent how prices are determined — only the Money values
that result from price determination. This means dynamic pricing, auction
price discovery, and negotiated B2B pricing are pre-model processes whose
outputs enter the model as Money values.

The consequence: the model cannot represent the price discovery process
itself as a commerce operation. It can represent the Commitment that
price discovery produces. This is the correct boundary for a model of
commerce state. A model that includes pricing strategy is an opinionated
system, not a formal model. The AuctionProcess auxiliary record below
represents the coordination mechanism that produces Tendered Commitments —
it does not represent the pricing algorithm.

### Primitive 1: Party

A Party is any entity that can participate in commerce. Parties hold
value, make commitments, fulfill obligations, and act as intermediaries
or guarantors.

```
Party {
  id: PartyID                    // globally unique, immutable, never reused
  type: PartyType
  locale: Locale {
    language: LanguageCode       // BCP 47 (e.g. "fr-MA", "ar-MA", "zgh-MA")
    currency: CurrencyCode       // ISO 4217 (e.g. "MAD", "EUR", "USD")
    jurisdiction: JurisdictionCode  // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (e.g. "MA", "FR")
  }
  capacity: Capacity {
    can_buy: bool
    can_sell: bool
    can_fulfill: bool
    can_guarantee: bool
    verified_at: Timestamp
  }
}

PartyType {
  Individual                     // a natural person
  Organization                   // a legal entity: company, NGO, government
  System                         // an AI agent or automated system acting
                                 // on behalf of a principal party
}
```

**Roles a Party plays in a Commitment:**

A Party does not have a fixed role. The same Party can be a buyer in one
Commitment and a seller in another. Role is contextual, not intrinsic.

```
PartyRole {
  Initiator      // proposes the Commitment, typically the buyer
  Counterparty   // accepts the Commitment, typically the seller
  Intermediary   // facilitates without owning the value being exchanged
                 // (marketplace, agent, freight forwarder, platform)
  Fulfiller      // executes the physical or digital transfer of value
  Guarantor      // backs the Commitment with their own capacity
                 // (bank in a Letter of Credit, escrow service)
}
```

**On AI agents as parties:**

When an AI agent takes a commerce action on behalf of a human, the
Commitment records both — the human as the principal party and the
AI system as the acting intermediary with PartyType::System. This
makes AI-mediated commerce fully auditable. The model does not treat
AI agents differently from human agents at the structural level. It
records them with precision.

**On franchise and multi-entity structures:**

The legal entity that holds the counterparty role is the party legally
responsible for the Commitment. In franchise commerce the franchise
owner is the counterparty, not the franchisor. The franchisor is an
intermediary providing brand and systems. This distinction matters for
dispute resolution, returns, and legal jurisdiction.

### Primitive 2: Value

Value is what moves between parties in every commerce operation. It
takes multiple forms but in every case represents something that has
worth to the receiving party.

```
Value {
  id: ValueID                    // globally unique instance identifier
  form: ValueForm
  quantity: Quantity
  state: ValueState
}
```

**ValueForm — the forms value takes:**

```
ValueForm {

  PhysicalGood {
    sku: SKU                     // what the good is
    condition: Condition {
      New | Used | Refurbished | Damaged | RequiresInspection
    }
    location: Location           // where it physically exists

        verified_at: Timestamp
      }
    }
  }

  DigitalGood {
    identifier: String           // product ID, token ID, license key
    exclusivity: DigitalExclusivity {
      Exclusive    // one party holds it at a time (NFT, unique certificate)
                   // transfer means originator loses it
      NonExclusive // multiple parties can hold simultaneously
                   // granting does not reduce provider's capacity
                   // (software license, streaming, API access)

    }
    currency: CurrencyCode       // ISO 4217, always present, never implicit
                                 // includes custom: CurrencyCode::Custom(String)

  }

  ContingentValue {
    trigger: ContingentTrigger {
      type: TriggerType
      parameters: Map<String, String>
      monitoring_period: DateRange
      monitoring_party: Option<PartyID>
    }
    if_triggered: Value
    if_not_triggered: Value      // often Value::Nothing
  }

  Nothing                        // explicit zero value
                                 // used in ContingentValue when trigger
                                 // does not fire (insurance with no claim)
}
```

**ValueState — the lifecycle of a value instance:**

```
// For physical goods and money:
ValueState {
  Available                      // no constraints, can be committed
  Reserved {
    commitment: CommitmentID
    basis: ReservationBasis {
      PhysicalStock              // item exists in a warehouse or store
      ProductionCapacity         // item will be produced, capacity confirmed
      TimeSlot {                 // a performer's time held for a service
        slot: TimeWindow
        capacity_unit: String    // "barber-time", "driver-availability"
      }
      RecurringTimeSlot {        // multiple future slots held
        slots: Vec<TimeWindow>
      }
      DriverCapacity             // gig economy: specific driver allocated
      Speculative                // no formal verification, risk accepted
                                 // used in dropshipping, made-to-order
                                 // where availability is claimed not confirmed
    }
  }
  UnderAuction {                 // value is subject to an active auction
    auction_process: AuctionProcessID
    current_high_commitment: Option<CommitmentID>  // current winning bid
    current_high_offer: Option<Money>              // current winning price
    closes_at: Timestamp
    // Value cannot be Reserved or Committed to any party
    // while UnderAuction — the auction process controls allocation
  }
  Committed { commitment: CommitmentID }  // allocated, transfer imminent
  InTransit { fulfillment: FulfillmentID }
  Transferred { to: PartyID, at: Timestamp }
  Returned { from: PartyID, initiated_at: Timestamp }
}

// For digital goods (non-exclusive):
ValueState {
  AccessGranted {
    to: PartyID
    granted_at: Timestamp
    expires_at: Option<Timestamp>
  }
  AccessSuspended {
    reason: SuspensionReason
    suspended_at: Timestamp
    restore_condition: RestoreCondition
  }
  AccessRevoked {
    reason: RevocationReason
    revoked_at: Timestamp
  }
  AccessExpired {
    expired_at: Timestamp
  }
}

// For exclusive digital goods (NFTs, unique certificates):
// Uses the same physical goods ValueState (Available → Transferred)
// because exclusivity means transfer follows the same conservation rule
```

**Critical constraint on Money:**

Money always carries its currency. There is no amount without a currency
in this model. Decimal alone is not a valid Money value. This eliminates
the entire class of currency confusion errors — accidental MAD-EUR mixing,
incorrect price comparisons across currencies — by making them impossible
to express.

### Primitive 3: Intent

An Intent is a party's expressed desire to engage in commerce. It exists
before any Commitment. It captures what the party wants, under what
constraints, and in what context.

Intent is a first-class primitive — not a precursor to be ignored but
a formal record of what the party desired before the Commitment formed.
This makes cart abandonment a formal state transition rather than an
afterthought webhook. It makes gift commerce expressible with recipient
and occasion context that persists through the Commitment.

```
Intent {
  id: IntentID                   // globally unique, immutable
  party: PartyID                 // who wants something
  desire: Desire {
    value_form: ValueForm        // what form of value (may be underspecified)
                                 // a party may want "a gift around 500 MAD"
                                 // without specifying the exact good
    constraints: Constraints {
      budget: Option<Money>
      timing: Option<TimingConstraint> {
        needed_by: Option<Timestamp>
        preferred_window: Option<TimeWindow>
        urgency: Urgency { Low | Normal | High | Critical }
      }
      quantity: Option<QuantityConstraint>
      preferences: Vec<Preference>  // ordered, weighted attributes
                                    // "prefers local vendors"
                                    // "prefers eco-certified"
    }
    context: IntentContext {
      occasion: Option<Occasion> {
        Birthday | Anniversary | Eid | Ramadan | MothersDay |
        ValentinesDay | WeddingAnniversary | Corporate | Custom(String)
      }
      recipient: Option<PartyID>   // who the value is for (gift commerce)
                                   // distinct from the initiating party
      channel: Channel {           // how the party is engaging
        Web | Mobile | Physical | Voice | Agent
      }
      urgency: Urgency
    }
  }
  state: IntentState
  history: Vec<IntentTransition>  // append-only, immutable
  created_at: Timestamp
  expires_at: Option<Timestamp>
}

IntentState {
  Active                          // party is engaged, intent is open
  Abandoned                       // party stopped without committing
                                  // a cart abandonment is Active → Abandoned
  Converted {
    commitment_id: CommitmentID   // the Commitment this Intent became
  }
  Expired                         // time limit reached without conversion
}

IntentTransition {
  from: IntentState
  to: IntentState
  at: Timestamp
  actor: PartyID                  // who caused this transition
  reason: Option<String>
}
```

**On multi-recipient intent:**

When a party intends to send gifts to multiple recipients — a customer
ordering for their mother, daughter, and son — the Intent carries
multiple recipients. Each recipient produces a separate child Commitment
but they all originate from one Intent. This preserves the single
customer journey while allowing independent fulfillment per recipient.

```
Intent.desire.recipients: Vec<Recipient> {
  party: PartyID
  address: Address
  items_desired: Vec<ValueForm>
}
```

---

### Primitive 4: Commitment

A Commitment is a formal agreement between two or more parties to
exchange value under specified terms. It is the central primitive of
the commerce model.

Every commerce operation either leads to a Commitment, is recorded
as a Commitment, or is the execution of a Commitment. Everything else
in the model exists to create, describe, or fulfill Commitments.

```
Commitment {
  id: CommitmentID               // globally unique, immutable, never reused
  
  parties: {
    initiator: PartyID           // who proposed the Commitment
    counterparty: PartyID        // who accepted it
    intermediaries: Vec<PartyID> // platforms, agents, fulfillment partners
                                 // may change as Commitment evolves
                                 // (new vendor joining a multi-vendor order)
  }
  
  subject: {
    offered: Vec<Value>          // what the counterparty provides
    requested: Vec<Value>        // what the initiator provides in return
                                 // usually Money, sometimes also goods
                                 // (trade, barter, exchange)

**Valid state transitions — the complete list:**

Only these transitions are valid. Any other transition is a model violation.

                                          (highest bid, first accept, or
                                          highest above reserve per mechanism)
Tendered    → Cancelled         requires: outbid (superseded_by is set), or
                                          auction cancelled, or

```

**No other transitions are valid. This list is exhaustive.**

**The Resolution Process — for PartiallyFulfilled Commitments:**

When a Commitment reaches PartiallyFulfilled because a value cannot
be provided, a Resolution Process opens for each unresolved item.

```
ResolutionProcess {
  id: ResolutionProcessID
  parent_commitment: CommitmentID
  unresolved_item: ValueID
  original_value: Money          // the monetary value of the unresolved item
  
  candidates: Vec<ResolutionCandidate> {
    id: ResolutionCandidateID
    proposed_by: PartyID
    substitute_value: Value
    fulfilling_party: Option<PartyID>  // if different from original
    price_delta: Money           // positive = customer pays more
    new_total: Money             // new Commitment total if accepted
    delivery_impact: DeliveryImpact {
      original_window: Timestamp
      new_window: Timestamp
      order_delivery_window: Timestamp  // slowest item across all children
    }
    state: CandidateState { Pending | Accepted | Rejected }
  }
  
  also_available: Option<CancelItem>
  
  state: ResolutionState {
    AwaitingCustomerDecision
    Resolved { outcome: ResolutionOutcome }
    Expired
  }
  
  deadline: Timestamp
}

ResolutionOutcome {
  SubstituteAccepted { candidate_id: ResolutionCandidateID }
  ItemCancelled
}
```

**The AuctionProcess — auxiliary coordination record for market-making:**

An AuctionProcess is not a sixth primitive. It is a coordination record
built from existing primitives that manages the collection of Tendered
Commitments and determines the winning Commitment when the auction closes.

The AuctionProcess operates on the Value being auctioned
(held in ValueState::UnderAuction) and produces Tendered Commitments
from bidders. When the auction closes it transitions one Tendered
Commitment to Accepted and the rest to Cancelled.

```
AuctionProcess {
  id: AuctionProcessID
  
  subject: ValueID               // the Value being auctioned
                                 // must be in ValueState::UnderAuction
  seller: PartyID
  
  mechanism: AuctionMechanism {
    English {                    // ascending price, open bids
      reserve_price: Option<Money>   // minimum acceptable price
      increment: Option<Money>       // minimum bid increment
      extension_window: Option<Duration>  // extend if bid in final minutes
    }
    Dutch {                      // descending price, first accept wins
      start_price: Money
      decrement: Money
      interval: Duration
    }
    SealedBid {                  // private bids submitted, highest wins
      reserve_price: Option<Money>
      reveal_at: Timestamp
    }
    Vickrey {                    // sealed bid, winner pays second-highest price
      reserve_price: Option<Money>
    }
  }
  
  tendered_commitments: Vec<CommitmentID>  // all bids submitted
                                           // each in Tendered state
  
  opens_at: Timestamp
  closes_at: Timestamp
  
  state: AuctionState {
    Scheduled                    // not yet open
    Open                         // accepting bids
    Closed {                     // bidding ended
      winning_commitment: Option<CommitmentID>
      winning_price: Option<Money>
      reason: AuctionCloseReason {
        NormalClose              // time expired
        ReserveNotMet            // highest bid below reserve
        BuyItNowExercised        // seller accepted an early offer
        SellerCancelled
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**How auction commerce flows through the model:**

```
1. Seller places item for auction
   Value(SKU-PAINTING).state: Available → UnderAuction {
     auction_process: AUC-001
     current_high_commitment: None
     closes_at: T+7days
   }

2. Bidder A places bid of 10,000 MAD
   Commitment(C-BID-A) {
     initiator: BidderA
     counterparty: Seller        // counterparty known (the seller)
     subject.requested: Money(10000, MAD)
     state: Tendered {
       offer: Money(10000, MAD)
       valid_condition: HighestBidAtClose
       closes_at: T+7days
       auction_process: AUC-001
     }
   }
   AuctionProcess(AUC-001).current_high_commitment: C-BID-A

3. Bidder B outbids at 12,000 MAD
   Commitment(C-BID-B) { state: Tendered { offer: 12,000 } }
   Commitment(C-BID-A) { state: Tendered { superseded_by: C-BID-B } }
   AuctionProcess(AUC-001).current_high_commitment: C-BID-B

4. Auction closes. Bidder B wins.
   Commitment(C-BID-B): Tendered → Accepted
   Commitment(C-BID-A): Tendered → Cancelled { reason: "Outbid" }
   Value(SKU-PAINTING).state: UnderAuction → Reserved {
     commitment: C-BID-B
     basis: PhysicalStock
   }
   AuctionProcess(AUC-001).state: Closed {
     winning_commitment: C-BID-B
     winning_price: Money(12000, MAD)
   }

5. Normal fulfillment proceeds
   Fulfillment(F-001): payment 12,000 MAD
   Fulfillment(F-002): painting delivered
   Commitment(C-BID-B): Fulfilled
```

### Primitive 5: Fulfillment

A Fulfillment is the execution of a Commitment — the actual movement
of value from one party to another, or the grant of access to digital
value.

A Commitment describes what will happen. A Fulfillment records what
did happen. The relationship between Commitments and Fulfillments is
one-to-many: one Commitment produces multiple Fulfillments as its
various obligations are executed.

```
Fulfillment {
  id: FulfillmentID              // globally unique, immutable
  commitment: CommitmentID       // which Commitment this executes
  
  items: Vec<FulfillmentItem> {
    value: ValueID               // which value is moving
    from: PartyID
    to: PartyID
    quantity: Quantity
  }
  
  method: FulfillmentMethod      // how the value moves (see DeliveryMethod)
  
  state: FulfillmentState
  evidence: Vec<Evidence>        // proof of completion
  history: Vec<FulfillmentTransition>  // append-only, immutable
  
  // For service Fulfillments
  period: Option<DateRange>      // the period this Fulfillment covers
                                 // (month of subscription service)
  
  // For contingent Fulfillments
  trigger_result: Option<TriggerResult> {
    TriggerFired { at: Timestamp, verified_by: Option<PartyID> }
    TriggerDidNotFire { window_closed_at: Timestamp }
  }
  
  planned_at: Timestamp
  started_at: Option<Timestamp>
  completed_at: Option<Timestamp>
}

FulfillmentState {
  Planned                        // scheduled, not yet started
  InProgress                     // movement or service delivery has begun
  Completed                      // value received by destination,
                                 // evidence recorded
  Failed {
    reason: FailureReason
    at: Timestamp
    recoverable: bool            // can retry vs terminal failure
  }
  Reversed {                     // return or refund — value moving back
    reason: String
    initiated_by: PartyID
    at: Timestamp
  }
}
```

**Evidence — proof that Fulfillment occurred:**

```
Evidence {
  ProofOfDelivery {
    photo: Option<Uri>
    signature: Option<Signature>
    timestamp: Timestamp
    location: Option<Coordinates>
    recipient: PartyID
  }
  PaymentReceipt {
    reference: String
    amount: Money
    timestamp: Timestamp
    mechanism: PaymentMechanism
  }
  AccessGrant {
    token: String
    granted_at: Timestamp
    expires_at: Option<Timestamp>
  }
  ServiceCompletion {
    confirmed_by: PartyID
    timestamp: Timestamp
    duration_actual: Option<Duration>
    notes: Option<String>
  }
  WarehouseReceipt {
    location: Location
    received_at: Timestamp
    quantity_verified: Quantity
  }
  BillOfLading {
    reference: String
    issued_by: PartyID
    goods_description: String
    origin_port: String
    destination_port: String
    issued_at: Timestamp
  }
  CustomsClearance {
    reference: String
    cleared_at: Timestamp
    jurisdiction: JurisdictionCode
  }
  TriggerVerification {           // for contingent Fulfillments
    trigger_type: TriggerType
    result: TriggerResult
    verified_by: Option<PartyID>
    timestamp: Timestamp
  }
}
```

**EntitlementConsumption — for metered digital services:**

When a digital service is accessed on a metered basis every access is
recorded as EntitlementConsumption rather than as a Fulfillment. Creating
a Fulfillment per API call would be architecturally incorrect and
computationally prohibitive. EntitlementConsumption is a lightweight
measurement record that links to its parent Commitment.

```
EntitlementConsumption {
  id: ConsumptionID
  commitment: CommitmentID
  entitlement: String            // "executions-per-month", "api-calls"
  consumed_this_event: u32
  total_consumed_this_period: u32
  total_allowed_this_period: u32
  period: DateRange
  timestamp: Timestamp
  overage: bool
}
```

When total_consumed exceeds total_allowed an overage child Commitment
is created automatically, priced at the metered rate.

## The Six Invariants

These hold at all times across all Commitments in any system that
implements the Warp Commerce Model. Violation of any invariant indicates
either a data integrity error or a bug in the implementing system.
An AI agent can verify these invariants at any point against the
formal objects.

**Invariant 1 — Value Conservation:**

For physical goods and money:
Value is never created or destroyed by a commerce operation. It transfers.
The originating party no longer holds the transferred value.

For non-exclusive digital goods (software licenses, streaming, API access):
Access rights are granted or revoked. The provider retains their copy.
Conservation applies to access rights, not to the goods themselves.
A provider cannot grant more access rights than their license permits
them to sub-license.

For exclusive digital goods (NFTs, unique digital certificates):
Ownership transfers. The originating party loses the token.
The original Invariant 1 applies without modification.

**Invariant 2 — State Monotonicity:**

CommitmentState and FulfillmentState transitions follow directed paths.
A Fulfilled Commitment cannot return to Accepted. A Cancelled Commitment
cannot become Fulfilled. The only apparent reversal — returning goods
or money — is expressed as a new forward-moving Commitment where parties
exchange roles, not as a state change on the original.

**Invariant 3 — Capacity Verification:**

A Commitment cannot reach Accepted state unless the capacity of all
parties for their roles has been verified.

For physical goods: inventory must be Available or Reserved with
verified basis (PhysicalStock or ProductionCapacity, not Speculative).
For services: time slot must be confirmed available with the performer.
For digital goods: license entitlement must be verified with the issuer.
For financial commitments: creditworthiness or guarantee must be confirmed.

Note on Speculative reservation: A Commitment may reach Accepted with
Speculative reservation but the Commitment must record the reservation
basis explicitly. Systems consuming the model can calculate capacity
risk from the basis. This is the honest representation of dropshipping
and made-to-order commerce.

**Invariant 4 — Temporal Integrity:**

Every state transition is recorded with a timestamp. No transition can
have a timestamp earlier than any previous transition on the same object.
History is append-only and immutable. Corrections to history are recorded
as new entries that supersede previous entries, not as modifications to
existing entries.

**Invariant 5 — Identity Permanence:**

CommitmentID, FulfillmentID, IntentID, PartyID, and ValueID are globally
unique and are never reused. A platform's native order ID maps to exactly
one CommitmentID. The mapping is established at Commitment creation and
never changes.

**Invariant 6 — Commitment Tree Consistency:**

For parent-child Commitment structures the sum of all child Commitment
subject.requested values (in their base currency) must equal the parent
Commitment subject.requested value at all times. When a child Commitment
is Modified (substitution, cancellation) the parent recalculates
immediately. The parent's state reflects the aggregate state of its
children.

## The Commerce Lifecycle

Every commerce operation follows this lifecycle. No exceptions.

## Platform Mapping

The model does not require existing platforms to change their data
structures. Each platform implements a Warp adapter that translates
its native representation to the model. The mapping is mechanical —
given a platform's native data there is exactly one correct Warp
model mapping.

**Shopify:**
```
Cart                    → Intent(Active)
Abandoned Checkout      → Intent(Abandoned)
Order(pending)          → Commitment(Proposed)
Order(paid)             → Commitment(Accepted)
Order(fulfilled)        → Commitment(Fulfilled)
Order(refunded)         → Commitment(Refunded)
Fulfillment             → Fulfillment entity
Refund                  → new Commitment(parties reversed) + Fulfillment(Reversed)
Customer                → Party(Individual)
Product variant         → Value(PhysicalGood) with SKU
```

**SAP S/4HANA:**
```
Quotation               → Commitment(Draft → Proposed)
SalesOrder              → Commitment(Accepted)
DeliveryOrder           → Fulfillment(Planned)
GoodsIssue              → Fulfillment(InProgress)
GoodsReceipt            → Fulfillment(Completed)
CustomerReturn          → new Commitment(parties reversed)
FIDocument (payment)    → Fulfillment(MoneyTransfer)
BusinessPartner         → Party
Material                → Value(PhysicalGood)
Letter of Credit        → Party(Guarantor) with Capacity
```

**Odoo:**
```
sale.order(draft)       → Commitment(Draft)
sale.order(sent)        → Commitment(Proposed)
sale.order(sale)        → Commitment(Accepted)
sale.order(done)        → Commitment(Fulfilled)
stock.picking           → Fulfillment entity
account.move(invoice)   → Fulfillment(MoneyTransfer)
res.partner             → Party
product.product         → Value(PhysicalGood)
```

**WooCommerce:**
```
Cart                    → Intent(Active)
Order(pending)          → Commitment(Proposed)
Order(processing)       → Commitment(Accepted)
Order(completed)        → Commitment(Fulfilled)
Order(refunded)         → Commitment(Refunded)
Shipment                → Fulfillment(InProgress → Completed)
Customer                → Party(Individual)
Product                 → Value(PhysicalGood)
```

**Agora (Warp-native):**
```
Agora emits typed Warp model events natively.
No adapter required.
Every Agora commerce mutation emits directly to the Warp event bus.
cart.abandoned.v1       → Intent(Active → Abandoned)
order.placed.v1         → Commitment(Accepted)
fulfillment.shipped.v1  → Fulfillment(InProgress)
fulfillment.delivered.v1 → Fulfillment(Completed)
```

## The AI Contract

This section is addressed specifically to AI systems using the Warp
Commerce Model. It defines the formal boundary between what an AI agent
can determine from the model alone and what requires external judgment.

### What an AI agent CAN determine from the model alone:

- The precise current state of any commerce object
- The complete set of valid next state transitions
- Whether a proposed action violates any invariant
- The complete immutable history of any commerce object
- Which parties have which obligations at any point in time
- Whether a Commitment is at risk (delivery window approaching, payment overdue)
- The monetary implications of any Resolution Process candidate
- Whether a return Commitment satisfies the condition requirements
- The total value flowing across any Commitment tree
- Whether Invariant 1 (value conservation) holds across the system

### What an AI agent CANNOT determine from the model alone:

- The market price of any good (pricing is outside the model)
- Whether a party is trustworthy beyond their recorded capacity
- Whether a product is appropriate for a specific recipient
- Which Resolution Process candidate is best for the customer
- Whether a service was performed to satisfactory quality
- What the best next action is (strategy is outside the model)

The model provides state. Strategy is built on top of state.
An AI agent uses the model for state verification and uses its
own reasoning for strategy decisions. This separation is intentional.
A model that includes strategy is not a model — it is an opinionated system.

### The AI Verification Protocol:

Before taking any commerce action, an AI agent MUST:

1. Load the current state of all relevant commerce objects
2. Identify the proposed state transition
3. Verify the transition appears in the valid transitions list
4. Verify all CommitmentConditions for this transition are satisfied
5. Verify no invariant is violated by the transition
6. Record the transition with the AI system as actor (PartyType::System)

If any step fails the action is not taken. The failure reason is
returned to the human principal. This protocol makes AI commerce
actions auditable, debuggable, and formally correct by construction.

### Commerce mistakes that become impossible with the model:

- Fulfilling a Cancelled Commitment
  (Cancelled → any state is not in the valid transitions list)

- Cancelling a Fulfilled Commitment
  (Fulfilled → Cancelled is not in the valid transitions list)

- Adding MAD and EUR without conversion
  (Money always carries currency, mixed-currency operations require
  explicit CurrencyConversion in CommitmentTerms)

- Sending WhatsApp to an unvalidated phone
  (PhoneNumber is a distinct type from String in the Warp type system
  derived from this model; the compiler catches this)

- Creating a Commitment for a customer in Disputed state
  (Capacity.can_buy is false while an active Dispute exists)

- Accepting a Commitment when inventory is Speculative
  without recording the basis
  (ReservationBasis is a required field on Reserved ValueState)

---

## Formal Sufficiency Test

The model is sufficient if for any commerce operation O that has ever
occurred on any platform in any country:

1. O can be expressed as a sequence of valid state transitions
2. The mapping from O to model states is unique and mechanical
3. The six invariants hold throughout the sequence
4. No concept outside the five primitives is required to represent O

**Test results to date:**

The following domains have been tested adversarially. All passed.

```
Physical goods e-commerce:
  ✓ Amazon (1P, 3P FBA, 3P FBM, mixed order)
  ✓ Alibaba (B2B, Letter of Credit, multi-party trade finance)
  ✓ Temu/Shein (dropshipping, speculative inventory, made-to-order)
  ✓ Net-a-Porter (luxury, authentication, provenance, white glove)
  
Multi-recipient commerce:
  ✓ Multi-recipient gifting with three addresses
  ✓ Stock failure with platform and vendor substitutes
  ✓ Price changes affecting total order value
  ✓ Returns at different locations from delivery locations
  
Physical retail POS:
  ✓ Simple cash transaction
  ✓ Multi-store chain with inventory transfer
  ✓ Franchise model with different legal entities
  ✓ Split payment (loyalty points + card + cash)
  ✓ Staff discount
  ✓ Same-visit return with partial refund routing
  ✓ Multi-currency (MAD, DZD, TND)
  ✓ Unified commerce (online intent → in-store purchase → partner pickup return)
  
Services:
  ✓ Simple appointment with no-show policy
  ✓ Multi-session service package
  ✓ Subscription with failed payment grace period
  ✓ Gig economy with surge pricing (estimated money)
  ✓ B2B consulting with milestone deliverables and acceptance
  
Financial commerce:
  ✓ BNPL with installment schedule
  ✓ Interest-bearing loan (money-to-money Commitment)
  ✓ Insurance (contingent value, trigger-based delivery)
  ✓ Escrow (three-party, release condition)
  ✓ Currency exchange (simultaneous payment)
  
Digital commerce:
  ✓ Software license (perpetual, seat-limited)
  ✓ Streaming subscription with access suspension
  ✓ API access with metered billing and overage
  ✓ NFT ownership and resale with artist royalty
  ✓ Open source dual-license (personal vs commercial)

Market-making commerce:
  ✓ English auction (ascending bids, reserve price, outbid supersession)
  ✓ Dutch auction (descending price, first-accept)
  ✓ Sealed bid auction (Vickrey pricing)
  ✓ Prediction markets (contingent value, probability-based payout)
  ✓ Two-sided marketplace matching (matching is infrastructure,
      Commitment is the model's entry point)
  ✓ Derivatives — forward contracts (future delivery at fixed price)
  ✓ Derivatives — options (contingent value, exercisable right)
  ✓ Tradeable derivatives (exclusive digital good representing the right)
  ✓ Collateral lending chains (collateral as CommitmentCondition,
      securitization as Commitment with DigitalGood subject)
```

**Result: No test has required a sixth primitive.**

All required additions have been extensions to existing primitive
structures. Market-making commerce required two extensions
(CommitmentState::Tendered, ValueState::UnderAuction) and one
auxiliary coordination record (AuctionProcess). Neither Tendered
nor UnderAuction introduces a new commerce concept — they are
specializations of existing Commitment and Value state that handle
the open-counterparty and contested-allocation properties specific
to auction mechanisms.

**On the "pricing outside the model" boundary and auctions:**

An auction's price discovery mechanism is outside the model. The
AuctionProcess records bids and determines the winner — this is
coordination infrastructure. The Tendered Commitment records the
bid as a formal offer — this is inside the model. The boundary is
correct: price discovery happens in the mechanism; the resulting
price enters the model as Money in the winning Commitment.

This means the model cannot represent "what would the price have
been under a different mechanism." It can represent "what price
was established by this mechanism and what Commitment resulted."
For a formal commerce model this is the correct scope.

## What Is Not In This Model

These exclusions are deliberate. Not oversights.

**Pricing and discount calculation** — how a seller determines the Money
they request. The model sees only the final Money value, not how it
was calculated.

**Inventory management** — how a seller tracks Value across all their
Commitments. The model sees ValueState for specific items, not the
seller's inventory system.

**Fraud detection** — whether a party's claimed capacity is truthful.
The model assumes parties accurately represent capacity. Fraud detection
validates those representations before they enter the model.

**Marketing and demand generation** — how Intents are created. The model
sees the Intent once it exists, not what caused it.

**Tax and compliance** — jurisdiction-specific additional obligations.
Tax is an additional Value transfer to a Guarantor party (government)
that follows the same model primitives but is governed by external rules.

**Recommendation and personalization** — which goods to offer to which
customers. This is strategy built on top of the model's state.

**Search and discovery** — how parties find goods and services.
Pre-commerce. The model activates when Intent forms.

A model that includes everything models nothing precisely.
These boundaries are where the model ends and the systems built
on top of it begin.
